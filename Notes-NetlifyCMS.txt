NETLIFY CMS NOTES

As described here, images can be stored in seperate folders by collection: https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#folder-collections-media-and-public-folder


  - name: 'projects'
    label: 'Projects'
    label_singular: 'Project'
    folder: 'content/projects'
    media_folder: 'subfolder2'
    public_folder: 'subfolder2'
  

    ^^ The last 2 lines here cause the CMS to store images for the project collection in a subfolder of 'content/projects/'. The relative path is 'content/projects/subfolder2

  Content folders are **automatically created**
